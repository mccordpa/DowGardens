      <p>Hello, on behalf of The Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow Foundation, welcome to Dow Gardens. Herbert Dow began developing this 110-acre landscape, comprised of an estate, garden, and forest, over a century ago. While Herbert used his property to grow a variety of crops and maintain his orchard, he also developed an interesting ornamental landscape based on one simple philosophy, to “never reveal the gardens’ whole beauty at first glance.” For Herbert, the gardens were never a finished idea. He believed that there was always room for improvement. Our talented team of horticulturists continue to honor his philosophy with their innovative garden designs. </br></br>
As a private residence, the Dow family spent countless hours in the gardens, learning, playing, and exploring together. Today, Dow Gardens welcomes over 250,000 guests per year to share in this legacy of beauty.</br></br>
As you walk through the doors of the Visitor Center you are entering the back of Herbert and Grace Dow’s property. We encourage you to step off the paved pathway, walk on the grass, and truly experience the spaces around you. There are many exciting things to discover!
